# What I changed

A brief overview of what chnages I made to Swizzle

# Affected files

1. File 1
2. Path/To/File 2

# Effects on performance (OPTIONAL)

| Trial       | Before      | After       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1           | seconds     | seconds     |
| 2           | seconds     | seconds     |

Average improvement: +-seconds

# Effects of API

e.g. "Users now cannot call the `swizzle4` method with only 2 parameters, which would break a lot of code"
