# Tutorial #6: Protocols

In the last tutorial, we designed a `Person` object. This person had a name and an age.

Let's create a simpel function that prints the name of a person

```
func printName(x: Person) {
    print(x.name);
}
```

Now, we can use this function to print the name of a person.

```
printName(p); // where `p` is a person
```
