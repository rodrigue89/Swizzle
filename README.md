This is just used for GitHub pages `/docs` option.

If you want the standard page, go to the [swizzle 1.0](https://github.com/SafelySwift/Swizzle/blob/swizzle-1.0/README.md) branch.
For a basic, interpreted prerelease (just a teaser), go to the [prerelease](https://github.com/SafelySwift/Swizzle/tree/prerelease) branch.
